-	persistence layer deals with all of the logic related to data access (CRUD)
-	presentation layer deals with all of the activities related to the web request and view 
-	domain layer contains classes to hold information that is retrieved from database records / the persistence layer
-	The service layer exposes business operations that could be composed of multiple CRUD operations

	
		persistence layer		@Repisotory
		-----------------

-	Logically speaking, data retrieval is not the duty of the controller because the controller is a presentation layer
component. 

-	data retrieval code in a separate layer - persistence layer. A persistence layer usually contains repository objects to access
domain objects. Since we don't want to write all of the data retrieval logic inside ProductController
itself, we delegated this task to another class called InMemoryProductRepository. 


-	Nowhere could we see a single line saying something like productRepository = new InMemoryProductRepository(). So we just 
put the line as 
		@Autowired
		private ProductRepository productRepository;
As soon as Spring sees the @Autowired annotation on top of the ProductRepository
reference, it assigns the object of InMemoryProductRepository to this reference since
Spring already created and holds the InMemoryProductRepository object in its object
container (the web application context). (pg 57)
