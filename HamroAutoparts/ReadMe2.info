					CHAPTER 5
					==========
	UPLOADING FILES
	===============
	
-	The controller knows nothing about view except the view name (i.e. file Name).
	It is the responsibility of the view resolver to map the correct view for the given view name.
	
-	For uploading files you need two dependencies as shown in POM.xml. Also you need to add private 
				MultipartFile productImage
	in the domain file.
	
	
-	You need enctype="multipart/form-data" in form if you are using file upload, else you dont.
-	On controller also add HttpServletRequest


		ContentNegotiatingViewResolver	(pg.134)
		===============================
-	ContentNegotiatingViewResolver does not resolve views itself but delegates them to
	other view resolvers based on the request
	
	try products/product?id=P1234 and products/product.xml?id=P1234 difference------------See XML
	
	http://localhost:8080/HamroAutoparts/products/product.json?id=P1234------------See JSON
